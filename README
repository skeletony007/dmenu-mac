Edit the `config.mk` file:

```
X11INC = /opt/X11/include
X11LIB = /opt/X11/lib

FREETYPEINC = /opt/homebrew/include/freetype2
```

THEN FOLLOW NORMAL BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (e.g. `make clean install`)

**Note** that we must set the shell environment variable `DISPLAY=:0`
where dmenu is launched, which tells dmenu that it should open in XQuartz.

An example keybind in [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) is:

```
cmd + shift - return : open -a "Xquartz" && export DISPLAY=:0 && cd /Applications; ls -d *.app | dmenu | xargs -I {} open "{}"
```
